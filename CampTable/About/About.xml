  <description>
A lightweight collapsible table for doing simple tasks while traveling.

Taken from CuproPanda's Survivalist's Additions, re-balanced, and packaged as a stand-alone mod.

Should be backwards-compatibile with games saved with the full mod. Just uninstall Survivalist's Additions, install this mod, and you no longer have a dependency on all the other pieces.
